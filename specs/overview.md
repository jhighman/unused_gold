# unused_gold Application Workflow - Detailed Overview

## Overview
The `unused_gold` application automates the processing of CSV files containing records of licensed individuals, encompassing reading, validating, mapping, and storing these records in a database. The application is divided into modular components, each with specific responsibilities for different aspects of the job.

## Detailed Workflow

### Job Scheduler (`JobScheduler.js`)
- Uses a job scheduling library (e.g., Agenda) to define and schedule the execution of jobs.
- Sets up a recurring task (`process csv`) that triggers the main job (`Job.js`) at regular intervals.

### Main Job Execution (`Job.js`)
- Upon being triggered by the scheduler, this script coordinates the entire CSV processing task.
- Sequentially executes defined steps: reading and processing the CSV file, then archiving it.

#### Step 1: Processing Records (`steps/Step1.js`)
- Reads the CSV file from a specified path using `ItemReader.js`.
- For each record in the CSV:
  - Validates the data using `ProcessRecord.js` (part of the services).
  - Maps validated data to a model (`LicensedPerson` model in `models/`).
  - Stores the mapped data in the database (using `JobRepository.js` in `repositories/`).

#### Step 2: Archiving File (`steps/Step2.js`)
- Responsible for archiving the processed CSV file.
- This could involve moving the file to a different directory or uploading it to a cloud storage service.

### Services
- **Item Reader (`ItemReader.js`)**: Reads and parses the CSV file, converting it into usable data.
- **Process Record (`ProcessRecord.js`)**: Contains business logic for validating each record, mapping it to the database schema, and handling the creation of database records.
- **Item Writer (not explicitly mentioned, but could be part of `ProcessRecord.js` or a separate service)**: Handles writing the processed data to the database.

### Models
- **LicensedPerson (`LicensedPerson.js` in `models/`)**: Represents the data schema of a licensed person in the database. Used to create new records.

### Repositories
- **Job Repository (`JobRepository.js` in `repositories/`)**: Provides an abstraction layer over database operations, specifically for creating records in the database.

### Logging and Error Handling
- Throughout the application, a logging utility (`logger.js`) is used to record significant events and errors.
- Error handling is integrated at every stage, ensuring that exceptions are logged and the jobâ€™s integrity is maintained.

## Conclusion
The `unused_gold` application is a well-structured system that efficiently processes CSV files, with a clear separation of responsibilities and robust error management. This modular design facilitates maintainability and scalability.
